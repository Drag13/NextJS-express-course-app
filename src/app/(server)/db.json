It uses the browser's history (which had never opened) and some other methods to group people into cohorts based on their interests and show them some ads which raise [some questions](https://www.eff.org/ru/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea) about privacy.",

To give an option to fix this, Google provides the way to opt-out of the FLoC by using HTTP Header `Permissions-Policy` with the value `interest-cohort=()`.",

      "- Sometimes, you are not able to manipulate HTTP headers at all. As an example - using GitHub Pages, you are not able to set any custom HTTP header. Recently, GitHub added `Permissions-Policy` but only for the github.com domain. Disabling FLoC for GitHub pages with custom domains is still impossible (`meta-equiv` is not working for the `Permissions-Policy`).",
      "- The second issue is much more controversial, however, it's still not null. The fact is that the mechanism of turning FLoC on/off belongs to the organization with one of the highest [income](https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2019Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=79552b8) comes from the ad. It's is not bad, but this means that at some point, Google may decide to change the mechanism turning FLoC off, ignore it or even remove it. I am not stating this will happen, but this seems possible.",

However, in the real world, you may have the Google Tag Manager script, some scripts from partners, or anything else that is out of your control. And yes, having all of this, you may still want to turn off the FLoC. Using ads doesn't automatically means that you allow them to show this ugly popup jumping right into the user's face, right? This case is similar - I still want to show ads, but I don't want to breach the user's privacy. For this case, this package can also help."

      "# NextJs and new Server Components - How to use and limitations",
      "Hello everyone, recently I have spent a lot of time dealing with the new feature in [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) - server components, and now I want to share my experience and some thoughts about this update, including the benefits, limitations, and how to use them in real-life scenarios.",
      "If you are interested in Next.JS or web performance in general, grab a cup of coffee and let's start reading!",
      "## Why were server components introduced?",
      "Let's start with the most important question - **\"Why were server components introduced?\"**",
      "As you probably already know, Next.JS works as follows (simplified):",
      "- The client requests the address served by the Next.JS server.",
      "- Next.JS, at runtime (optimizations with caching may occur), receives the necessary data to create the page.",
      "- Then, it creates an HTML page that is sent to the client, along with the javascript code. Since the page is just plain HTML, the user sees it as it loads and, unlike SPA, doesn't have to wait for React to create it from scratch on the client-side.",
      "- After receiving the client bundle, the hydration process takes place - transforming static HTML into the familiar React application that the user can interact with. If hydration is not performed, the user won't be able to interact with the HTML page because all event listeners are added at this stage",
      "Schematically this looks something like this:",
      "![./default-schema.png](./default-schema.png)",
      "The reason for all this non-trivial process is to ensure that your users see the content they need as quickly as possible and doesn't leave your website frustrated. It also simplifies the life of SEO robots and increases the chances of your page ranking higher in search results. Meanwhile, the developer can work in the familiar and convenient React with all its advantages - a component approach, HMR, and a rich toolkit.",
      "Unfortunately this process has drawbacks, the biggest of which is that it takes time to hydrate, during which the application is non-interactive. The larger your bundle, the more time it takes to hydrate. There is even a possibility that the user has already loaded the page, tries to interact with it, but it doesn't respond because the main thread is busy. This leaves the impression that the page doesn't work at all, and people may just leave and tell their friends that your store doesn't work.",
      "The second drawback is that, as in hydration and the React application lifecycle, all components participate, even those whose content never changes. This, accordingly, reduces the response time of your page to user actions, which is bad for the user experience.",
      "And here come the server components to the rescue, which try to solve both problems at once by:",
      "- **Dependencies used in server components are not included in the bundle at all**. This reduces its size and speeds up the moment when your page becomes interactive.",
      "- **Server components do not participate in either hydration or the application lifecycle**, which speeds up the application's response time (giving more time for other operations) and saves your phone's battery.",
      "Of course, such magic is not free, so server components have significant limitations (some of which almost completely negate their usefulness, at least for now).",
      "## Rules and limitations of server components",
      "**The first rule of server components** is that server components cannot have added behavior such as useState, useEffect, onClick, and other interactive features. This is logical since server components cannot be changed on the client-side. If you still need some behavior, you need client components. Regular functions, including fetch, are allowed. But keep in mind that server components run on the server, so they cannot access the browser API, window, and document objects. Another interesting point is that native interactivity of elements has not disappeared, so forms, checkboxes, radio buttons, links, summary, and all other components with built-in behavior will work fine.",
      "Also, server components cannot use context, which means that many familiar tools built on context - such as Redux Toolkit, Emotion, and even the popular MUI component library - do not work with server components. And this, in my opinion, is the biggest and most significant drawback of server components, which almost negates all their benefits. However, there is an experimental server context, but it is not yet used by third-party libraries and does not work correctly during navigation.",
      "**The second rule of server components** is that all components are considered server components until otherwise stated. If you need a client component, you must add the 'use client' directive at the beginning of the file with the components, before all imports.",
      "**The third rule of server components** is that importing a server component to the client automatically transforms it into a client component, thereby depriving it of all the advantages I mentioned above. This moment is very important, so I emphasize it again: any server components imported into a client component are automatically converted into client components. This effect is transitive - sub-components also become client components automatically, and so on until the last component in the hierarchy.",
      "The practical consequence of this is that if you add the `\"use-client\"` directive to your root component (such as a page), all its imports and the imports of their imports will automatically be converted to client components, which will still be rendered on the server-side but lose the benefits of server components, such as reduced bundle size and avoiding re-rendering; therefore, the `\"use-client\"` directive should be used as low in the import hierarchy as possible, or alternatively, you can use children in client components, as long as the composing component is a server component because there is no direct import.",
      "**Finally, the fourth rule of server components** is that they can be asynchronous and can receive data directly in the component body, without any useEffect. Then, this data can be processed and passed to the client components, which can create context and add some interaction. And for handling errors that occur during asynchronous operations, you can add an error.jsx/tsx file. This is quite convenient and slightly improves the impression of all previous limitations, but not much.",
      "## Wrapping up",
      "In summary, the technology of server components has the potential to make your applications faster by reducing the bundle size. However, the inability to use context and libraries built on it almost completely negates their usefulness in the real world. Even if your page is completely static but uses a popular CSS in JS library like Emotion for styling, you cannot fully utilize server components - at best, you can use them as a container for convenient data retrieval, but obviously, this is not what developers had in mind when they added server components.",

      "# Perfrunner - automated tool to track your website speed changes",
      "![perfrunner intro image](~/img/kdpv/perfrunner-intro.jpg)",
      "## Quick intro",
      "A few months ago I worked on performance improvements for one React-based web application. I tried different tricks to improve initial application loading and I was really annoyed with the way of testing my changes. I had to launch the application several times to get average results. I had to repeat all launches against at least two types of networks (4g and my current). And I had to repeat abovementioned tests once again for cache and cache-less scenarios. For the one single change, I had to run at least 12 tests. Needless to say, this was not fun.",
      "I decided that I don't want to do this anymore and this is how the [Perfrunner](https://github.com/Drag13/perfrunner) appeared.",
      "Perfrunner is a simple automated, CLI based tool that helps you track website performance changes. It collects some useful performance metrics like first and largest-contentful-paint, loaded resource size, and reports them back to you. The cool part is that Perfrunner does not only a single run but a series of runs against different networks, cache, and CPU conditions to give you as much information as possible!",
      "In other words, Perfrunner loads your application several times (3 by default) against each condition, calculates average results, and displays you the difference between all previous runs. You don't have to run them manually or calculate difference anymore, it is all automated!",
      "## Demo",
      "Let's start from a simple demo.",
      "First things first, you need to install Perfrunner and add launch script to the package.json file:",
      "```cmd",
      "npm i perfrunner -D",
      "```",
      "```json",
      "{",
      "  \"scripts\": {",
      "    \"perfrunner\": \"perfrunner\"",
      "  }",
      "}",
      "```",
      "and run Perfrunner to get inital data.",
      "```cmd",
      "npm run perfrunner https://drag13.io",
      "```",
      "Now, change something that might affect performance (I added jQuery to the top of the page) and run Perfrunner one more time. Open folder named `generated/{your_site_name}` and then open a `default-report.html` file.",
      "It will look like this (clickable):",
      "<a href=\"./original.png\" target=\"_blank\" ><img alt=\"Perfrunner report for original network, 25ms diff for largest-contentful-paint\" src=\"./original.png\"/></a>",
      "In this report you will see at least four different charts:",
      "- Application Events with `First-Paint`, `First-Contentful-Paint`, `Largest-Contentfult-Paint`, `DomContentLoaded` and `DomInteractive` events",
      "- Common performance metrics like `Layout Duration`, `Script Duration` and `Recalculate Style Duration`",
      "- Size of the resources loaded before the First-Contentful-Paint event",
      "- All resources size",
      "If you are using performance marks, you will also get marks chart as well.",
      "But what is perhaps the most important point, you can switch to the second tab and see how your changes affect the performance for another network/CPU/cache conditions:",
      "<a href=\"./fast3g.png\" target=\"_blank\" ><img alt=\"Perfrunner report for original network, 25ms diff for largest-contentful-paint\" src=\"./fast3g.png\"/></a>",
      "As you can see, for the fast-3G network, the First-Contentful-Paint event appeared 75 ms later than for the regular network.",
      "You can also instruct Perfrunner to use additional network conditions, like `slow-3g` or `regular-4g`:",
      "```cmd",
      "npm run perfrunner http://drag13.io -- --network slow-3g fast-3g hspa regular-4g online",
      "```",
      "or you can do testing against cached or not cached resources:",
      "```cmd",
      "npm run perfrunner http://drag13.io -- --cache true false",
      "```",
      "And of course you can combine different options together to get as much information as you need:",
      "```cmd",
      "npm run perfrunner http://drag13.io -- --network slow-3g fast-3g hspa regular-4g online --cache true false",
      "```",
      "Apart from network conditions, Perfrunner also supports CPU throttling with -T flag:",
      "```cmd",
      "npm run perfrunner http://drag13.io -- -T 8",
      "```",
      "This will set 8x throttling for your CPU. It is useful when you want to test your changes against slow devices.",
      "For more available options, please check [readme](https://github.com/Drag13/perfrunner/tree/development/packages/perfrunner-cli#all-options)",
      "## Advanced tricks",
      "Perfrunner is more flexible than it appears at first sight. First of all, if you don't want default-html reporter, you can switch it to CSV or JSON format, using `--reporter` flag. You also can write your own reporter and use it with option:",
      "```",
      "npx perfrunner http://drag13.io --reporter my-custom-reporter.js",
      "```",
      "where reporter should look like:",
      "```js",
      "module.exports = (outputFolder, data, args) =>",
      "  console.log(outputFolder, JSON.stringify(data), args);",
      "```",
      "Another useful trick is that Perfrunner also collects all Chrome traces from every test run. If you will need more detailed information, you can open `generated/{your_site_name/traces}` and get all the additional information you need.",
      "## Troubleshooting.",
      "Perfrunner is based on [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer), so it has all weaknesses and advantages of it. If you struggle with launching Perfrurunner, please visit [troubleshooting](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/troubleshooting) page. From my side, Perfrunner supports `--chrome-args` and `--ignore-default-args` flags. It also supports `--executablePath`, so you can launch Perfrunner on your own Chrome instance if nothing else helps.",
      "## Final words",
      "Summarizing, Perfrunner is a great tool to quickly check your performance improvements. It supports various network conditions, CPU throttling, and much more.

And here I want to discuss one of such pitfalls - inlined runtime chunk that might prevent you from correct using one of the most useful security header - Content-Security-Policy.",
      "## Identifing the issue",
      "Let's start. If you have ever opened the output index.html, you've probably already seen something like this:",
      "```html",
      "...",
      "<!--index.html-->",
      "<div id=\"root\"></div>",

      "What is this first piece of code? It is a small chunk of webpack runtime logic which is used to load and run your application. It is safe (at least for now), already optimized, and minified. If you remove or alter it, your application will be broken. Despite all of this, the fact it uses an inline technique might bring you some trouble if you start improving your application with [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) HTTP header. For those, who already CSP Header, the problem should be obvious, but if you are not familiar with this technique, I will explain a bit more.",
      "A long time ago when [netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator) was young, we didn't have any mechanism to define trusted sources browser may use safely. If the browser see the script tag, it evaluates it and executes it. If the browser see a script with src, it loads it and executs it. If the browser see an image ... you understand, it loads image and renders it. Despite (or because) the simplicity, this behavior opens door to some troubles like [XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting).",
      "However, times changed. Nowadays we can control what sources are trusted and what resources can be used by the browser. This is done by the HTTP Header named Content-Security-Policy. This header defines whitelists the trusted sources:",
      "```",
      "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self';",
      "```",
      "In this example, the server, using Content-Security-Policy header, dictates to the browser to use resources only from the same domain index.html was loaded from. If an attacker will find XSS vulnerability and embed some script inside the page, the browser will refuse to load it, because loading scripts from other domains already forbidden. And if attacked embed plain javascript on the page, payload will also not work. Because inline resources required special permission - unsafe-inline.",
      "```",
      "Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'unsafe-inline';",
      "```",
      "This header is so cool, that it can also forbidd [eval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) which makes this header really great against different types of injection-based attacks. If you are interested in some details, here you can find more about Content-Security-Policy and some other useful security headers - [https://drag13.io/posts/security-headers](https://drag13.io/posts/security-headers/index.html).",
      "Now you should see the issue. If you decide to protect your site with CSP-Header (and I highly recommend doing this), you will have to allow unsafe-inline, because, in another case, React will just not work. Which in turn, leaves the door open to other, potentially malicious, inlinings.",
      "## Making the decision",
      "Now, when you see the issue, what can you do?",
      "* Use [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) attribute. However it requires some backend (nonce should be cryptographically secure random token) and Edge had some bugs related to it. So this might be plan B.",
      "* Opt-out from using unsafe runtime script inlining. The good news is that this option is already supported with INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK variable and it is quite easy to set up it. To use react without unsafe inline code, you need set ```INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK``` to false, like here:",
      "```json",
      "/*package.json*/",
      "\"build\": \"(SET INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false) && react-scripts build\",",
      "```",
      "Or just use add INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false to the [.env](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) file. Now your inlined chunk will be moved out of the index.html. However this is not end. Except runtime chunk, react also inlines images that are smaller then 10kB. Inlined images are also forbidden by default with CSP header. You may leave this or setup React not to include images inside the bundle.  Just add",
      "```IMAGE_INLINE_SIZE_LIMIT=0``` to your .env file and that's it.",
      "Now you can use React.JS application with CSP header without unsafe-inline (of course if you don't have other inlined code).",
      "But what about performance? When we move the runtime-chunk out from the index.html, doesn't it slow the application loading? I was also wondering about this.

As an example, I will use the same React application as previously, however, this will work the same way for Angular, Vue, or classical website.",
      "## Testing the application on a slow network",

      "First of all, we need to define the network conditions that should be applied. Right now we can set up `downloadThroughput`, `uploadThroughput` and `latency`. For example, a slow 3g network will look something like this:",

      "If you're intrigued by the idea of exploring another strongly typed, functional language, you should definitely give ReScript a try. This guide is designed to assist you in setting up a fundamental React application using ReScript and Vite, offering you a fantastic opportunity to delve into this exciting combination of technologies. With ReScript's type safety and the speed of Vite, you'll be well on your way to building robust and highly performant web applications that are a joy to work with. So, let's embark on this journey of enhancing your web development skills by seamlessly integrating React, ReScript, and Vite into your workflow.",
      "## Prerequisites",
      "Before diving into the setup process, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You'll also need a code editor, and for the purposes of this guide, we'll assume you're using Visual Studio Code.",
      "## Step 1: Initialize a Vite Project",
      "To get started, open your terminal and run the following command:",
      "```bash",
      "npm init vite retest",
      "```",
      "This command initializes a Vite project named \"retest\", which provides a basic structure for your project.",

      "*.bs.js",
      "lib",
      "```",
      "## Step 2: Clean Up the Project",
      "Upon project initialization, you may find some unnecessary files and folders created. To clean up your project, follow these steps:",
      "* Navigate to the \"retest\" folder: `cd retest`",
      "* Create a new \"src\" folder: `mkdir src`",
      "* Delete the following files and folders:",
      "* * counter.js",
      "* * main.js",
      "* * public",
      "* * javascript.svg",
      "* Move the style.css file to the \"src\" folder.",
      "Your project structure should now be much cleaner and easier to use.",
      "## Step 3: Install Dependencies",
      "Next, install the required dependencies for React, ReScript. Run the following commands:",
      "```bash",
      "npm install @rescript/react rescript -D",
      "npm install react react-dom",
      "```",
      "Additionally, it's a good idea to install the [ReScript VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode) to enhance your development experience.",
      "## Step 4: Update package.json",
      "Open your `package.json` file and update the scripts section to include the following commands:",
      "```json",
      "\"scripts\": {",
      "  \"build:res\": \"rescript\",",

      "```",
      "These scripts will help you build and run your ReScript and Vite development server.",

      "To configure ReScript, create a bsconfig.json file in the project root and populate it with the following content:",
      "```json",
      "{",
      "  \"name\": \"drag13proj\",",

      "This code sets up your React app to render within the \"app\" element in your HTML file. If the element with id `app` will not be found, you will see an error in console. This is the first time we see a ReScript here. I am using the pattern matching to conditionally render the app if `#app` exists and what is very cool - ReScript helps me to handle unhappy cases. ",
      "## Step 7: Connect ReScript to index.html",
      "In the `index.html` file located in the project root, change the `<script>` tag's src attribute from `/main.js` to `./src/index.bs.js.`",
      "This change ensures that your ReScript code will be included in your project correctly.",
      "## Step 8: Start ReScript and Vite",
      "To start your development environment, open two separate terminal windows and run the following commands:",
      "```bash",
      "npm run dev:res",
      "npm run dev",
      "```",

      "You can import global styles into your ReScript code by adding the following line at the beginning of your index.res file:",
      "```reason",
      "%%raw(\"import './style.css'\")",
      "```",
      "This allows you to include your global CSS styles in your project - such as `reset.css` or other styles you want to be applied globally.",
      "## Step 10: Add a New React Component",
      "To add a new React component, create a new file in the \"src\" folder named App.res. In this file, include the following code:",
      "```reason",
      "@react.component",
      "let make = (~title) => <h1> {React.string(title)} </h1>",
      "```",
      "This code defines a basic React component named \"App\" with a prop for the title. Very important to follow the convention - name of the variable should be `make`. ",
      "## Step 11: Update index.res with the New Component",
      "In your `index.res` file, update the rendering code to include the new \"App\" component:",
      "```reason",
      "ReactDOM.Client.Root.render(root, <App title=\"Hello world!\" />);",
      "```",
      "In the similar way you can add other components to build your app. Just remember to name the variable `make` and use single file per component.",
      "## Step 12: Use CSS Modules for Component Styling",
      "To apply styles to your `App` component using CSS modules, follow these steps:",
      "* Create a new file in the \"src\" folder named `app.module.css`.",
      "* Add the following CSS code to app.module.css:",
      "```css",
      ".header {",
      "  color: #4AF626;",
      "}",
      "```",
      "In your `App.res` component, import the styles using the following code:",
      "```reason",
      "@module external styles: {..} = \"./app.module.css\";",
      "```",
      "Apply the \"header\" class to the <h1> element in your \"App\" component using square brackets:",

      "```jsx",
      "<h1 className={styles[\"header\"]}> {React.string(title)} </h1>",

Якщо ви не хочете читати - просто склонуйте [цей репозиторій](https://github.com/Drag13/rescript-react-vite-example), встановіть залежності та експерементуйте.",
      "## Передумови",
      "Перш ніж приступити до налаштування, переконайтеся, що на вашій системі встановлені Node.js та npm. Вам також знадобиться редактор коду, і для цього прикладу я буду використовувати Visual Studio Code.",
      "## Крок 1: Ініціалізація проекту Vite",
      "Для початку відкрийте ваш термінал та виконайте наступну команду:",
      "```bash",
      "npm init vite retest",
      "```",
      "Ця команда ініціалізує проект Vite з назвою \"retest\", який надає основну структуру для вашого проекту.",

      "```",
      "*.bs.js",
      "lib",
      "```",
      "## Крок 2: Підготовка",
      "Після ініціалізації проекту ви можете знайти деякі непотрібні файли та папки. Щоб очистити свій проект, виконайте такі дії:",
      "* Перейдіть в папку \"retest\": `cd retest``",
      "* Створіть нову папку \"src\": `mkdir src``",
      "* Видаліть наступні файли та папки:",
      "* * counter.js",
      "* * main.js",
      "* * public",
      "* * javascript.svg",
      "Також перемістіть файл style.css до папки `src` і тепер ваша структура проекту буде набагато зручнішою в роботі.",
      "## Крок 3: Встановлення залежностей",
      "Далі встановіть необхідні залежності для React, ReScript. Виконайте такі команди:",
      "```bash",
      "npm install @rescript/react rescript -D",
      "npm install react react-dom",
      "```",
      "Також раджу встановити офіційне розширення [ReScript для VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenglou92.rescript-vscode) для полегшення розробки",
      "## Крок 4: Оновлення package.json",
      "Відкрийте файл `package.json` та додайт наступні команди в розділ \"scripts\":",
      "```json",
      "\"scripts\": {",
      "  \"build:res\": \"rescript\",",
      "  \"dev:res\": \"rescript build -w\",",
      "  \"dev\": \"vite\"",
      "}",
      "```",
      "Ці команди знадобляться вам для того щоб запустити ваш застосунок.",
      "## Крок 5: Налаштування ReScript",
      "Для налаштування ReScript створіть файл bsconfig.json в корені проекту та заповніть його наступним вмістом:",
      "```json",
      "{",
      "  \"name\": \"drag13proj\",",
      "  \"sources\": [",

      "  \"bs-dependencies\": [\"@rescript/react\"]",
      "}",
      "```",
      "Не забудьте замінити `drag13proj` на бажане ім'я проекту. Або не міняйте, якщо воно вам пасує 😄",
      "## Крок 6: Створення файлу index.res",
      "У папці `src` створіть новий файл з ім'ям index.res (res це розширення файлів ReScript) та додайте наступний код ReScript:",
      "```reason",
      "switch (ReactDOM.querySelector(\"#app\")) {",
      "| Some(rootElement) => {",
      "    let root = ReactDOM.Client.createRoot(rootElement)",

      "```",
      "Цей код запускає наш React застосунок. Якщо елемент з id `app` не буде знайдено, ви побачите помилку в консолі. Це наша перша зустріч з ReScript і код може видатися трохи не зрозумілим, але насправді все прсто:",
      "Я пробую знайти елемент з id #app і якщо він є виконується гілка ініціалізації. Якщо немає - ми побачимо помилку у консолі. Ця конструкція називається [Pattern Matching](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/manual/latest/pattern-matching-destructuring) і це щось накштал switch-case але на стероїдах - дуже потужна річ насправді.",
      "## Крок 7: Підключення ReScript до index.html",
      "У файлі `index.html`, який знаходиться в корені проекту, змініть атрибут src тегу `<script>` з `/main.js` на `./src/index.bs.js`.",
      "Ця зміна забезпечує правильне включення вашого коду ReScript у ваш проект.",
      "## Крок 8: Запуск ReScript та Vite",
      "Для запуску середовища розробки відкрийте два окремі термінали (можна було б поставити `concurrently`, але для тествого проекту, певно, не варто) та виконайте наступні команди:",
      "```bash",
      "npm run dev:res",
      "npm run dev",
      "```",
      "Це запускає компілятор ReScript в режимі спостереження і сервер розробки Vite паралельно. Тепер ви можете відкрити ваш проект за адресою `http://127.0.0.1:5173/.`",
      "## Крок 9: Додавання глобальних стилів",
      "Ви можете імпортувати глобальні стилі в свій код ReScript, додавши наступний рядок в початок вашого файлу index.res:",
      "```reason",
      "%%raw(\"import './style.css'\")",
      "```",
      "Це дозволить вам включити глобальні стилі CSS у ваш проект, такі як `reset.css` або інші глобальні стилі (наприклад bootstrap 👿).",
      "## Крок 10: Додавання нового компонента React",
      "Щоб додати новий компонент React, створіть новий файл в папці `src` з іменем `App.res`. В цьому файлі додайте наступний код:",
      "```reason",
      "@react.component",
      "let make = (~title) => <h1> {React.string(title)} </h1>",
      "```",
      "Це створить нам новий компонент, який приймає `title` в якості пропс. Доречі, ви звернули увагу на відсутність типу в title? Це ще одна сильна сторона ReScript - автоматичне виведення типів, в залежності від використання. І робить він це краще ніж TypeScript",
      "Ще один важливий момент це дотримуватися конвенції - ім'я змінної для компоненту обов'язково повинно бути `make`.",
      "## Оновлення index.res з новим компонентом",
      "У файлі index.res оновіть код, щоб включити новий компонент \"App\":",
      "```reason",
      "ReactDOM.Client.Root.render(root, <App title=\"Hello world!\" />);",
      "```",
      "Таким же способом ви можете додавати інші компоненти для побудови вашого застосунку. Просто не забудьте називати змінну `make` .",
      "## Крок 12: Використання модулів CSS для стилізації компонента",
      "Для застосування стилів до вашого компонента `App` за допомогою модулів CSS, дотримуйтесь цих кроків:",
      "* Створіть новий файл в папці `src` з іменем `app.module.css`.",
      "* Додайте наступний код CSS у app.module.css:",
      "```css",
      ".header {",
      "  color: #4AF626;",
      "}",
      "```",
      "У вашому компоненті `App.res` імпортуйте стилі за допомогою наступного коду:",
      "```reason",
      "@module external styles: {..} = \"./app.module.css\";",
      "```",
      "Застосуйте клас \"header\" до елементу `<h1>` у вашому компоненті \"App\" за допомогою квадратних дужок:",
      "```jsx",
      "<h1 className={styles[\"header\"]}> {React.string(title)} </h1>",
      "```",
      "Тепер СSS модулі готові працювати.",

      "## Content-Security-Policy",
      "One of the most important security header. It was created to prevent the usage of any resource from an untrusted source.",
      "Let's go to the short example first:",
      "Evil Bob found [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) vulnerability on Alice's site. He decides to inject the script into the web-page to steal some customer data. He put this script tag into her page",

      "Within this header you can deny inline scripts and eval usage (goodbye inline XSS), specify a checksum for the scripts (goodbye substitution of the 3rd party scripts), allow specific domains for your images, fonts, and styles. It can restrict fetch requests, deny usage of your site inside an iframe (goodbye [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)) and much more. CSP header is very flexible and can support almost all of your needs.",
      "### Can I use Content-Security-Policy?",
      "CSP header [supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-http_headers_csp_content-security-policy) by almost all browsers including IE (but with a special name - X-Content-Security-Policy). Some of the directives may not be supported across different browsers but this will not ruin the header.",

But Alice already has setup CSP policy, so his attempt to download javascript from untrusted resources fails. But Evil Bob is smart. He changes the type of the injected script to \"text/plain\". Now, CSP protection will allow loading script, because it is not javascript anymore and should not be executed. But sometimes, browsers try to be too smart. They may check the content of the loading \"text\", and decide to execute it as JavaScript. This named sniffing and this behavior varies depending on the browser.",

Of course, you can turn off not only a camera but also autoplay (useful when you are showing some ads from 3rd party vendors), microphone and very much more.

So, we need to automate them. As you know, when you make a commit few git events appear - pre-commit, post-commit and so on. We can use them to run our own scripts before the code will be committed or pushed. But there is a problem -  git hooks are not shareable. And that's why [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) appears. This package wraps the git events and runs your scripts from package.json.

      "## Publish",
      "Great, we are almost done. So, let's say we are ready to publish the package to npm. As you know, much work should be done before - tests, documentation update, version, and tags update. Easy to forget something, yeah? So, it is a good idea to automate this process too. For that purposes, we will use native npm hooks - preversion, version, and postversion. Add next lines to scripts section your package.json",

      "When you will run npm version command, preversion script will run tests, version script will build your code and generate all documents. Then version will be increased and then all will be commited and pushed out. Now all you need is to run npm publish command and that's all. Just to commands and everything else will be done without any efforts from your side.",
      "At last, we need to specify what folders should be included in the project and where entry point can be located. Update package.json last time",

      "# Advanced TypeScript - Tips and Tricks",
      "It would seem that in 2022 it is a bit too late to talk about TypeScript - the technology is well known and popular. Despite this, some times TypeScript still used half-heartedly. Simple type annotations, null checking and nothing more. Therefore, I brought some interesting, purely practical cases to show mighty TypeScript in action!",
      "## Narrowing primitives",
      "Let's start simple. Imagine that we have a function that takes a key as input, extracts a translation from the dictionary by the key and returns it. What will be the type of this key? Most likely - string. But it is clear that not everyone string is a valid key - we certainly do not need the entire British Encyclopedia right? And of course we don't want to have typos.",
      "This problem can be solved in different ways. For example, if the translation does not exist, you can throw an exception (users will be very happy to get run time exception, right?). The second option is to return the same key, and pledge the fact that the key does not exist, so that later you can find out what went wrong. In any case, we will find out that the problem has occurred somewhere later, but we would like to know in advance.",
      "And here TypeScript has a very elegant solution - if you don't need the whole string, then be honest about it and just declare a subset:",
      "```typescript",
      "type TranslationKey = 'grey';",
      "function translate(key: TranslationKey){...}",
      "```",
      "Thanks to this technique, we get several advantages at once:",
      "- We are protected from typos and keys that we are not yet ready for at the build stage.",
      "- When some key changes `( grey-> gray)`, we will immediately see all the places where we need to update the code.",
      "- IntelliSense works - using the keys has become much easier, you don’t have to climb and look for how this one is spelled every time `landing_big_ad_imageblock_subheder` (by the way, did you notice a typo?)",
      "The same trick can be used if we want to validate a value before using it:",
      "```typescript",
      "type Email = string;",
      "const sendEmail = (email: Email)=> {...}",
      "sendEmail('fake@email'); // fails",
      "```",
      "When we try to pass `sendEmail` any string to the method, TS will force us to check this string before, for example, by writing a [guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards):",
      "```typescript",
      "// don't use in production please",
      "const isValidEmail = (maybeEmail: unknown): maybeEmail is Email =>",
      "  typeof maybeEmail === \"string\" && /^\\S+@\\S+$/.test(maybeEmail);",
      "```",
      "If you are interested in the details of how it works, here is a link to the [documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html).",
      "## Derived from types",
      "We figured out the primitives, now I want to show another feature that I often use - creating a new type based on an existing one. In OOP, we usually use inheritance, but TypeScript allows you to transform one type into another. Surely you have already used the type `Partial<T>` or `Required<T>` ,which come straight out of the box. But in addition to built-in types, we can create our own, for example, like this:",
      "```typescript",
      "type User = { name: string };",
      "type Dto<T> = { [key in keyof T]: unknown };",
      "type UserDto = Dto<User>;",
      "```",
      "First, I described the domain model with which I am ready to work. For this example, I created a type User with a single field name that must contain a string. But since I don't want to relay on the third party service that the data comes from, I want to validate the response from the server. To do this, I created a derived type `UserDto` in which I am stating that I had no idea what they would send us. Now I, as well as everyone who comes after, will be forced to check the data before using it.",
      "Naturally, using this approach, you can also write a validator schema.",
      "Step 1. Let's create a generic type that contains all the same fields as the future type T, and the values ​​will be functions that take an argument of an unknown type and return a sign that the argument belongs to the given type.",
      "```typescript",
      "type DtoValidator<T> = {",
      "  [key in keyof T]: (v: unknown) => v is T[key];",
      "};",
      "```",
      "Step 2. Now we can write a validator in the form of a guard, in which we check the passed argument. If it satisfies the given conditions, we recognize that it belongs to the type NotEmptyString.",
      "```typescript",
      "const isNotEmptyString = (v: unknown): v is NotEmptyString =>",
      "  typeof v === \"string\" && v.length > 0;",
      "```",
      "Step 3. Finally let's put it all together into a validation scheme. Please note that now TS will ensure that all fields in the scheme are described and correctly filled out. If we miss something, TypeScript will throw an error.",
      "```typescript",
      "const userValidator: DtoValidator<User> = {",
      "  name: isNotEmptyString,",
      "};",
      "```",
      "The great thing here is that when we extend the domain model with a new field, TS will automatically remind us that this field is also needed to check.",
      "On my project, we use this approach for form validation. There is a form model, and a validator model is built on its basis. When form fields change (which happens periodically), TypeScript tells us where we went wrong.",
      "## Dynamic modification of types",
      "This trick might be especially relevant if you're using contexts in React, but the idea will work everywhere. TS allows you to infer new types on the fly based on the data you pass in. This may sound a little confusing, so let's look at an example.",
      "Let's write a function that greets the user:",
      "```typescript",
      "type User = { firstName: string };",
      "type Greetings = { greetingText: string };",
      "const getGreetings = ({ firstName, greetingText }: User & Greetings) =>",
      "  `${greetingText}, ${firstName}!`;",
      "```",
      "Obviously, the username will appear in runtime, but the text of the greeting itself can be static. You can write a higher order function that will inject `greetingText` into `getGreetings`.",
      "```typescript",
      "const greeterFactory = () => (user: User) =>",
      "  getGreetings({ ...user, greetingText: \"Hello\" });",
      "const greeter = greeterFactory();",
      "greeter({ firstName: \"Vitalii\" });",
      "```",
      "Everything is fine, but this solution is not generic and I want to have a general one that would:",
      "- Worked with arbitrary types.",
      "- Removed from the required type those fields that are already contained in the embedded object.",
      "A naive implementation might look like this:",
      "```typescript",
      "function factory<TModel, TResult, TInjected extends Partial<TModel>>(",
      "  callback: (m: TModel) => TResult,",
      "  inject: TInjected",
      ") {",
      "  return (m: Omit<TModel, keyof TInjected>) => callback({ ...inject, ...m });",
      "}",

      "  greeting: \"hello\",",
      "  name: \"Vitalii\",",
      "})(\"Joker\");",
      "```",
      "Since the type of the embedded object completely overrides the required type, the resulting type can be anything, even a string. This is clearly not what we would like. And it's good that TypeScript was smart enough to catch it. Therefore, the code will have to be [rewritten](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70154354/higher-order-function-how-to-deduct-injected-type-from-model-without-casting/70334649#70334649):",

      "const working = factory(greeter, {",
      "  greeting: \"hello\",",
      "})({ name: \"test\" });",
      "```",
      "Now everything works as expected, apart from a t-i-i-iny moment. First, it's hard to read, although the idea here is pretty simple and revolves around TypeScript's ability to extract types from functions and the Omit utility type. And secondly, in runtime, both in injected, and in props, an object with a much larger number of fields can get in, and this should be borne in mind.",
      "For us, this approach came in handy when we wrote our connectors to the data store in React. As a result, only those fields that were not in the store had to be passed to the component, it would “take” the rest itself, and TypeScript would check that we had not forgotten to forward the missing ones. Since all objects are under our control, the nuance I mentioned was not a problem.",
      "## Summary",
      "As you can see, TypeScript is more than just type annotation. It allows you to create subsets, projections, type inference on the fly, and much more that I didn't mention. Although there is no TypeScript at runtime, well-written types make development easier and can prevent misses.",
      "On the other hand, seemingly obvious TypeScript solutions don't work. Mistakes are incomprehensible and not obvious, especially at the beginning of working with the language (and, to be honest, later too). The start of the project is also slower, since you need to design and describe types, and then also fix where you missed.",
      "Still, the convenience that TypeScript provides is well worth it. Introducing new people to the project and even returning to a module that you have not worked with for at least a month is much easier and more enjoyable. The main thing is to maintain balance, as the main character of one very philosophical game said. If you see that TS complicates the support of your code, then someone has taken a wrong turn."

If you will try to do it directly, TypeScript will show an error like this: `Property 'customProperty' does not exist on type 'Window & typeof globalThis'.ts(2339)`. This happens because `customProperty` not exists in the corresponding type and TypeScript disallows you to operate with not existed properties.",
      "The popular way to solve this (and incorrect), is to cast the desired object to `any` and then, assign or use new properties. However, in this case, we will lose IntelliSense and type safety.

      "# TypeScript Tips and Tricks - Utility Types With Examples",
      "[![typescript tips and trics declarations](~/img/kdpv/ts-declarations.png)](./index.pug)",
      "TypeScript is a very powerful language, however, it heavily relies on the types. And sometimes, you may found that you write more types than actual code. In this case, you should take a look into the Utility types that will help you to write fewer types and still keep your code type-safe.",
      "Let's start from the simple example - imagine that you have a list of events produced by the application and a list of handlers for them. So you may write (don't do this way) something like this:",
      "```typescript",
      "type Action = \"move\" | \"stop\";",
      "function handleAction(action: Action) {",
      "  if (action === \"move\") {",
      "    console.log(\"i am moving\");",
      "  }",
      "  if (action === \"stop\") {",
      "    console.log(\"i am stopped\");",
      "  }",
      "}",
      "```",
      "Suddenly, requirements changes (requirements always changing suddenly 😀), and now you need to handle `beep` action. You update the Action type, but might forget to update `handleAction` function which will lead to a bug. However, with help of utility types, you can be protected from such type of failer:",
      "```typescript",
      "type Action = \"move\" | \"stop\" | \"beep\";",
      "const handlers: Record<Action, () => void> = {",
      "  move: () => console.log(\"i am moving\"),",
      "  stop: () => console.log(\"i am stopped\"),",
      "  beep: () => console.log(\"beeep!\"),",
      "};",
      "const handlerAction = (action: Action) => handlers[action]();",
      "```",
      "Now, when new action will come, you will be automatically notified that you need to extend your handlers. If you accidentally remove some code from handlers, you will be notified as well. Great TypeScript feature!",
      "You can do the same trick with objects:",
      "```typescript",
      "type User = { name: string; age: number };",
      "type ValidationMap = Record<keyof User, (user: User) => boolean>;",
      "const validations: ValidationMap = {",
      "  age: ({ age }) => age > 21,",
      "  name: ({ name }) => name != null,",
      "};",
      "```",
      "This was done with the help of the `keyof` keyword. It extracts keys from the interface or type and creates another type. Simplifying it may look like this:",
      "```typescript",
      "interface IPerson = {age: number, name: string};",
      "type PersonProps = keyof IPerson; // 'age | name';",
      "```",
      "This tip is very useful for the validation scenarios when you want to ensure that all properties of the object are handled.",
      "If you want to know how to extract types from the array (or tuples), it's also easy, just don't forget to use `as const` statement:",
      "```typescript",
      "const events = [\"success\", \"faile\"] as const;",
      "const valueExtractors: Record<typeof roles[number], Dispatcher> = {",
      "  success: () => dispatch(\"success\"),",
      "  faile: () => dispatch(\"faile\"),",
      "};",
      "```",
      "Another useful utility type, you might be already familiar with is `Partial<TModel>` type. It is very handy when you are filling a domain model from untrusted resources or do some null/undefined behavior testing. Imagine that you are fetching big objects that might be partially filled and want to avoid `Cannot read property XXX of null` type exception. In this case, you can use Partial type and TypeScript will automatically suggest you verify your data:",
      "```typescript",
      "// This model we are using inside the application",
      "type DomainUser = {",
      "  name: string;",
      "  age: number;",
      "};",
      "type UserDto = Partial<DomainUser>; // This model we expect to get from API",
      "const fetchUser = (): UserDto => ({});",
      "console.log(fetchUser().age.toString()); // Now, TypeScript is warning about the possible error and we now that check is needed",
      "```",
      "`Partial<T>` is a very useful utility type, however, it has an issue. It is not working with nested objects. You can use this code to write your own DeepPartial type:",
      "```typescript",
      "type DeepPartial<T> = {",
      "  [P in keyof T]?: T[P] extends Array<infer U>",
      "    ? Array<DeepPartial<U>>",
      "    : T[P] extends ReadonlyArray<infer U>",
      "    ? ReadonlyArray<DeepPartial<U>>",
      "    : DeepPartial<T[P]>;",
      "};",
      "```",
      "The code seems a bit tricky but it uses only two technics - conditional types and inferring. Both of them will be covered in the next article.",
      "Speaking about partial types, I can't ignore one more very helpful classes - `Omit<TModel, TKeys>`. It helps you to exclude or override some properties based on already created class:",
      "```typescript",
      "type User = {",
      "  name: string;",
      "  email: string;",
      "  sex: NonExistedTypeFitsAll;",
      "};",
      "interface MultiEmailUser extends Omit<User, \"email\"> {",
      "  email: string[];",
      "}",
      "```",
      "As you can see, using this technique you don't need to copy-paste user type. You just transform on type into something that fits better. If you need to omit more properties, just use Union type here:",
      "```typescript",
      "type CuttedUser = Omit<User, \"email\" | \"email\">;",
      "```",
